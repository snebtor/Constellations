# Constellations mapping tool

Pressing 'w' stores the coordinates of current shapes.

Pressing 'r' loads the shapes previously saved in polygons.txt

Pressing any other key applies texture on polygons.

Use mouse clicks to draw polygons with 4 vertices (only works with shapes with 4 vertices)

Once drawn, press any key apart from 'w' and 'r' to apply texture on them
